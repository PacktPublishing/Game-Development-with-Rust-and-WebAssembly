**Learn how to run Rust on the web while building a game**

## What is this book about?
The Rust programming language has held the most-loved technology ranking on Stack Overflow for 6 years running, while JavaScript has been the most-used programming language for 9 years straight as it runs on every web browser. Now, thanks to WebAssembly (or Wasm), you can use the language you love on the platform that's everywhere.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Build and deploy a Rust application to the web using WebAssembly
* Use wasm-bindgen and the Canvas API to draw real-time graphics
* Write a game loop and take keyboard input for dynamic action
* Explore collision detection and create a dynamic character that can jump on and off platforms and fall down holes
* Manage animations using state machines
* Generate levels procedurally for an endless runner
* Load and display sprites and sprite sheets for animations

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the project files are organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
button {
    font-family: 'Ken Future';
    background: -72px -60px url('Button.svg');
    border: none;
    width: 82px;
    height: 33px;
}

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This game development book is for developers interested in Rust who want to create and deploy 2D games to the web. Game developers looking to build a game on the web platform using WebAssembly without C++ programming or web developers who want to explore WebAssembly along with JavaScript web will also find this book useful. The book will also help Rust developers who want to move from the server side to the client side by familiarizing them with the WebAssembly toolchain. Basic knowledge of Rust programming is assumed.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
